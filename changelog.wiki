### DeusEx

* SetupGroupGizmos tool
  - add option to lock axes, that don't carry a gizmo
    - this then allows for easy and lazy group rotation using the native op, without having to pick the right axis, and even with the rotation gizmo(s) disabled
    - disable locking via `R` or `L` keys


### Prime <sup>previously Standard</sup>

* Assetbrowser tools
  - add Assetbrowser Bookmarks
    - draw buttons for 10 bookmarks in the asset browser header
    - support jumping to library/catalog via click, saving via `SHIFT` click, and clearing bookmarks via `CTRL` click
      - see tooltips
		- support jumping to library/catalog via new `ALT + 0` to `ALT + 0` keymaps
    - bookmarks store and recall library, catalog and thumbnail size
    - bookmarks are stored on disk in `assetbrowser_bookmarks.json` in Blender's config folder
  - with the catalog sidebar closed, display the library and catalog in the asset browser header
  - support maintaining bookmarks, across Library renames (Blender restart required)
  - NOTE: you can't bookmark any catalog in the 'Current File' library
  	- and you can't bookmark any library's 'Unassigned' catalog either

* Shading Pie
  - BevelShader
    - support toggling it per-object
    - add arrow buttons to increase or decrease the global or per-object radius
      - halve and double the curretn value by default
      - with SHIFT held down, do -25% or +33% instead for smaller adjustments
  - Smooth, Flat, ToggleAutoSmooth tools
    - redo them completely, and maintain the same look and UX in 4.1 as before
    - in Blender 4.1
    	- support auto smooth toggling by adding/removing geo node mod
    		- sort it at the end of the stack, but before mirror and array mods
    		- support intanced objects
    	- support Auto Smooth for CURVE objects
    - support SURFACE objects in object mode (Blender does too, so why not)
    - properly deal with hidden children and mod objects when in local view and when either or both are included in a Smooth or Flat shading operation
    - when shading Smooth, optionally (but by default) enable Auto Smooth for objects carrying boolean mods
    - when shading Smooth with `ALT` pressed, sharpen edges via new operator angle property, not via a mesh's auto smooth angle prop as before
    - when Flat shading with `ALT` pressed to clear sharps, seams, etc, also disable Auto Smooth, if enabled, or present
    - limit options, that are exposed in redo panel, depending on context, hide what doesn't apply
    - when Flat shading and removing creases, make option, that avoids removal of creases while subd mods with `use_crease` are present, work per-object not globally or entire selection
    - add object mode fading HUD summarizing the shading changes
  - display Clear Custom Normals op, independently of Auto Smooth being enabled in 4.1
    - neither custom normals nor sharp edges require Auto Smooth anymore

* MaterialPicker tool
  - support fetching materials from and assigning them to CURVE objects

* SelectHierarchy tool
  - indicate number of hidden parents/children in fading HUD

* Group Add/Remove tools
  - add little fading HUD to visually confirm what happened

* ToggleRegion tool
  - avoid exception when library stored asset browser settings, is no longer registered

* Thread, ToggleSmooth and QuadSphere tools
  - deal with Auto Smooth changes in 4.1

* CreateAssemblyAsset tool
  - fix issues caused by 1.7's change to UUID based catalog storage

* Modes Pie
	- Surface Slide tool
		- support instanced meshes
  - avoid exception when trying to mode change a linked object with library override

* addon preferences
	- add GetSupport tool, placed at the top of the addon prefs
  - add custom updater 
    - NOTE: since it's only introduced now in 1.8, it will only be of use for upcoming releases, so can't be used to install this very  1.8 update yet
    - allows for very easy addon update installation from .zip file, and from inside of Blender, instead of manually from the file browser
    - finds matching .zip file(s) in home and Downloads folder
    - allows selecting one of them them or manually selecing a file in any other location
    - extracts the file to a temporary location, and installs update when quitting Blender
    - like a manual update installation from the filebrowser, this maintains previous addon settings and custom keys
    - see installation instructions for details  

* Customize tool
  - tweak M3 theme
    - adjust to edit mode color changes in 4.1
    - make crease edges green
  - when customizing the startup file, while the Shading Pie has been activated, disable native cursor display and activate custom cursor and object axes drawing instead
  - fix issues modifying keymap in 4.1
  - add hidden Toolbar Popup keymaps
		- set Annotate to D
		- set Annotate Erase to E
		- without deliberately creating these keymaps, the default keymaps will change depending on the active tool, now they are consistent
	- invert Transform Modal Map's proportional editing keymaps, so increasing the size is done by scrolling up and decreasing by scrolling down
